Where does Javascript Go?

Browser most common place to encounter and easiest place to practice, browsers read and display content using HTML, style that content using CSS and give interactivity by following instructions in a javascript file. 

Running/executes	- When a browser reads and acts on a javascript program

Link a JavaScript file to a web page using the <script> tag and the src property: 

ie <script src="scripts.js"></script>

Insert JavaScript directly into a web page inside <script> tags:

<script>
alert("Hello there.");
</script>

console.log(“”)		- Send a message to directly to js console. 
debug			- Fix errors for a page 



Variables
————

Variables 	- Ways of storing and keep of track of information in a program. 
var		- short for variable 
var name	- name a variable 
var name = 0	- Assign value to variable, value on the right into the variable on the left  
String		- Series of characters inside quote marks
value		- information inside a variable can be numbers or strings 
Numbers		- used for making calculations
Strings		- used for words messages and other text 


var message= "hello!";
alert(message);
message = "Welcome to Javascript basics"
alert(message);

Naming variables — Some words cannot be used to name variables because they’re reserved for something else. i.e. functions

Names can’t start with a number, can only contain letters and numbers and the $ and _ symbols.

Variables should be named something logical, clear and descriptive to make easy to understand, 


Strings and Numbers
————

Numbers		- used for making calculations
Strings		- used for words messages and other text 
/		- escape character, use it before or after to make sure it’s treated as normal character, not part of the program. 

Can use single or double quotes for strings, just be consistent. Use single quotes when you need to use double quotes i.e. class name.
