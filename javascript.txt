Javascript Basics
————

JS used to add interactivity such as parallex scrolling, light boxes and generally immersive websites. We applications depend on javascript. 

Isn’t limited to just web browser, can also be used server side, node.js is a great example of this, lots of big businesses use node.js. Desktop applications are also produced in Javascript. Vast capabilities and application. 

This course will cover the following; 

- Syntax // different commands special words and punctuation. 
- Programming concepts // common ideas used in various languages (variables, arrays etc) 
- Vocabulary // Programming terms that enable you to explain various programming terms.
- Techniques // Best practices and ideas that make it easy. 

Statement	- Like a sentence, statements have to finish with “;”
Program		- Set of statements that runs one after another, statement needs to be complete before next starts.

alert("Welcome");
document.write("Welcome to JS basics");
alert("thanks");

Where does Javascript Go?

Browser most common place to encounter and easiest place to practice, browsers read and display content using HTML, style that content using CSS and give interactivity by following instructions in a javascript file. 

Running/executes	- When a browser reads and acts on a javascript program

Link a JavaScript file to a web page using the <script> tag and the src property: 

ie <script src="scripts.js"></script>

Insert JavaScript directly into a web page inside <script> tags:

<script>
alert("Hello there.");
</script>

console.log(“”)		- Send a message to directly to js console. 
debug			- Fix errors for a page 



Variables
————

Variables 	- Ways of storing and keep of track of information in a program. 
var		- short for variable 
var name	- name a variable 
var name = 0	- Assign value to variable, value on the right into the variable on the left  
String		- Series of characters inside quote marks
value		- information inside a variable can be numbers or strings 
Numbers		- used for making calculations
Strings		- used for words messages and other text 


var message= "hello!";
alert(message);
message = "Welcome to Javascript basics"
alert(message);

Naming variables — Some words cannot be used to name variables because they’re reserved for something else. i.e. functions

Names can’t start with a number, can only contain letters and numbers and the $ and _ symbols.

Variables should be named something logical, clear and descriptive to make easy to understand, 


Strings and Numbers
————

Numbers		- used for making calculations
Strings		- used for words messages and other text 
\		- escape character, use it before or after to make sure it’s treated as normal character, not part of the program. 

Can use single or double quotes for strings, just be consistent. Use single quotes when you need to use double quotes i.e. class name.


Spaces, tabs and new lines in JavaScript
————

Javascript can appear on different lines and with different amount of spaces, although you can use these but should really use space to make code easy to read.

Capturing Visitor Input
————

prompt() captures visitor input from a dialog box. You can store that input in a variable like this:

var answer = prompt('What color is the moon?');


Concatenation — The process of combining strings is called "concatenation". In JavaScript, you combine strings with a + operator 

var name = "Dave";
var message = "Hello " + name;


Working with Strings
————

.length		- returns the number of characters inside a string (counts characters including spaces)
.toUpperCase()	- returns a copy of a string with all uppercase letters
.toLowerCase()	- returns a copy of a string with all lowercase letters
	

console.log(passphrase.length);  - passphrase = object / .length = properly — can access the property of object using ‘.’ 

method		- Something that can be performed on an object () parenthesis are what indicate if something is method. 
object		- objects have properties also have methods which are actions the object can perform. 

var passphrase = "Open Sesame";
console.log(passphrase.length);
console.log(passphrase.toLowerCase());
console.log(passphrase);
console.log(passphrase.toUpperCase());

var stringToShout = prompt("What should i shout?");
var shout = stringToShout.toUpperCase();
shout += "!!!";
alert(shout);

var id = "23188xtr";
var lastName = "Smith";
var userName = id.toUpperCase() + "#"; // 23188XTR#
userName += lastName.toUpperCase(); // 23188XTR#SMITH


The Variable Challenge
————

Write what you want to achieve first, then gradually test piece by piece. 


"<h2>There once was a [adjective] programmer who wanted to use JavaScript to [verb] the [noun].</h2>"

var adjective = prompt('Please type an adjective');
var sentence = "<h2> There once was a " + adjective;
var verb = prompt('Please type an verb');
var noun = prompt('Please type an noun');
alert('all done. Here is the message!');
sentence += ' programmer who wanted to use JavaScript to ' + verb;
sentence += ' the ' + noun + '.<h2/>';
document.write(sentence);
