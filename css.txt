Inline vs Internal
————
	
User agent styles	- Browser defaults to make html presentable.
Author styles		- Inline, internal and external.

Inline			- directly inside element. Not best practice, used sparingly if at all. Difficult maintenance. 
Internal		- embedded in page, using style tags within head of page. Can create conflicts and duplicates. 
External		- Most efficient, one file changes style for whole website. Flexibility advantageous and it’s cached. 

Link tag		- Links styles to page. Comprises of at least 2 attributes; 
rel=“stylesheet”	- Specifies the relationship between the link of the pages.
href=“”			- href points to location of the file, includes path.
import statement	- makes CSS more modular, base, layout and typography… although can increase load time.


Selectors 
————

CSS rules		- Tell browsers how to render HTML elements, made of selector and declaration block. 
Selector		- Defines what is being targeted, where to apply the style. 
Declaration block	- Decorations that style the element we’re selector. Comprises of property and a value. 
Property		- part of element we want to change. 
Value			- how we want to change the property. 

*			- Universal selector, applies to every element and overrides everything else.
element selectors	- Used to select elements on the page.


ID selectors
————

Element can only have one ID and a page can only have one element with the same ID name. 

#idname			- pound symbol followed by ID name. 
name=“”			- Can be used to find elements with that id. 


Class selectors
————

Class can be use to classify and target more than one element, element can have multiple classes attached to it. 
A class and an ID can be applied to one element, but ID’s carry more ‘weight’ than a class selector. 

.classname		- only targets elements with matching class tag.



Descendant selectors
————

Target elements that are decedents of other elements, used for targeting lists. 

ul li {}		- adds specificity to descendants. 


Pseudo-Classes
————

Similar to classes, but aren’t explicitly written in source code. Can target elements dynamically based on interaction. 

a:link			- links that have not yet been visited. 

a:visited		- target visited links 
a:hover			- targets links that are hovered over
a:active		- applied when element has been activated by the user
a:focus			- only applied to interactive elements, when browser determine a user is ready to interact with. 
/* */			- comments for CSS that the browser does not interpret


Common data types
————

datatypes		- keywords, number, length, image, url.
