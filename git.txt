git checkout		| view different version from the one looking at currently
git master		| go back to master branch
git diff		| view was different between to versions of repo

Working with branches

branches		| Alternate versions that run in parrell to the original trunk
master branch		| also known as trunk
git branch NAME		| create new branch name
git checkout master	| return to trunk
git checkout NAME	| switch to new branch
git checkout -b NAME	| Creates a branch of NAME and switches to it directly 
git branch		| Shows list of all branches
git branch -D name	| Deletes branch with name

Introduction to Merging

merging			| bringing together commits in branches back into trunk
merge conflict		| have to make decision about which changes to commit to trunk
git merge branchName	| merges the history of branch name to current branch 
 
Working with remotes

git log			| shows log of all of our commits
